# Global Life Expectancy Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes global health and socioeconomic indicators to identify key factors associated with life expectancy. Both statistical and machine learning models were used to compare linear and non-linear relationships.

## Data
- WHO Life Expectancy dataset (via Kaggle)  

## Methodology
- Data cleaning and handling of missing values  
- Correlation analysis and multicollinearity reduction  
- Linear regression for interpretability  
- Random forest regression for improved accuracy  

## Models
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor 

## Conclusion
Two models were used to predict global life expectancy. Linear regression explained about 83% of the variance, highlighting strong links between education and income. Random forest improved accuracy with a Test R² of 0.94 and lower RMSE (2.06), capturing non-linear relationships. Key insights show that education and income are stronger predictors than healthcare spending, while HIV/AIDS and adult mortality remain the main negative factors affecting life expectancy.
